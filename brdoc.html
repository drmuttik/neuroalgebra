<h2 id="unpacking-and-running-braincell">Unpacking and Running BrainCell</h2>

<p>(For Users with NEURON and Anaconda Installed):</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Start with BRAINCELL</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>- Download the <strong>BRAINCELL</strong> software package from
    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/LeonidSavtchenko/BrainCellNew">[(https://github.com/LeonidSavtchenko/BrainCellNew]{.underline})</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>- Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to a preferred
    <blockquote>
      <p>location (e.g., c:\my\braincell).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>- Ensure that all files and folders within the <strong>BRAINCELL</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>directory are extracted.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Configuring File Permissions and Initiating NEURON Compilation</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>For Windows 11 users, it's important to ensure that any *.exe file
    <blockquote>
      <p>in the NEURON directory, specifically located at c:\nrn\bin\,
operates with administrative rights. However, for users with a
version of Windows &lt; 11, this step is not required. To achieve
this, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Updating File Properties</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Navigate to the NEURON directory c:\nrn\bin\ and locate the
    <blockquote>
      <p>*.exe files. Adjust the properties of each *.exe file with
administrative rights.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Run BrainCell</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Executing the init. Hoc / or init.bat. You can find this file in the
    <blockquote>
      <p>directory path ...\init.hoc.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Compiling NEURON .mod files:</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Once you have downloaded BrainCell, it will be ready to run.
    <blockquote>
      <p>However, if you make any changes or add new mod files, you must
activate build_mechs.bat to compile the NEURON *.mod files. This
step is essential to ensure the proper functioning and integration
of the NEURON modules into your system.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Running PS Scripts on Windows</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>If your Windows configuration restricts the execution of batch (bat)
    <blockquote>
      <p>files, you can opt to run PowerShell (ps1) files instead. Windows,
by default, imposes restrictions on the execution of PS1 files. To
overcome this limitation, follow the steps below:</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Open PowerShell in administrator mode. Run the following command:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser</em></p>

  <p>This command bypasses the execution policy for the current user,
allowing PS1 files to run without restrictions.</p>

  <p>This action is a one-time requirement; you will not need to repeat it
in the future. After performing this step, you can effortlessly run
PS1 files.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Running BrainCell</strong></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>- Open the c:\my\braincell directory.</p>

  <p>- Double-click on the "<strong>init.bat</strong>" file to execute it.</p>

  <p>- This action should launch Neuron and open the <strong>BRAINCELL</strong> window.</p>

  <p>- In the <strong>BRAINCELL</strong> window, you can select either "Astrocyte" or
"Neuron" per your requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="unpacking-and-running-braincell-for-users-without-neuron-and-anaconda-installed-but-with-the-previous-version-of-python-installed">Unpacking and Running BRAINCELL (For Users without NEURON and Anaconda Installed but with the previous version of Python installed):</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you do not have NEURON and Anaconda installed or are experiencing
issues with BrainCell after their installation, please follow these

OBJ or ZIP) in the home directory …\BrainCell\Geometry\ either
…\Astrocyte or …\Neuron.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open a BRAINCELL and import the 3D structure file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adjust the scale of the model to the appropriate size for your
needs. This may involve resizing, repositioning, or rotating the
model to match your desired dimensions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have created a basic 3D model of the brain cell, you can
add nanostructures to the model using either an experiment or
computer simulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to add nanostructures to the astrocyte model using an
experiment, you will need to use specialised software Astro in
MATLAB to manipulate at the nanoscale level.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, you can use computer simulations to add
nanostructures to the 3D cell. These simulations can help you to
understand how the nanostructures interact with the brain cell and
how they affect its function.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have added the nanostructures to the model, you can use the
3D modelling software to visualise the changes and understand how
they affect the overall structure and function of the brain cell.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, you can refine and optimise the model as necessary to
achieve your desired level of accuracy and detail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, creating a brain cell model using BRAINCELL is a complex
process that requires specialised software and expertise in 3D
modelling and nanoscale science. By following these instructions and
utilising the appropriate tools and techniques, however, you can
create a highly accurate and detailed brain cell model that can be
used for a wide range of scientific and educational purposes.</p>

<h1 id="the-outlines-of-experimental-data-or-approximations-required-to-create-a-realistic-brain-cell-model">The outlines of experimental data or approximations required to create a realistic brain cell model.</h1>

<p>Here are the details:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It is preferable to have a 3D reconstructed tree of main cell
processes that can be imported from <strong><em>https://neuromorpho.org</em></strong> in
any format. Alternatively, an artificially generated cell arbour can
be used, with the branching pattern and branch diameters
representing the average (typical) cell from the population of
interest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Astrocyte nanostructures are essential, and a sample (20-50) of
nanoscopic astroglial processes reconstructed using 3D
(serial-section) EM is necessary. The sample should have rendered
surface coordinates and will be used to obtain statistical
properties of the ultrathin processes to be generated in the model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neuron nanostructures are also needed, and "BRAINCELL" can
automatically generate synaptic spines with different distribution
densities, geometries, and contacts with synapses. Synapses can be
located both on the spines and directly on the dendrites. The user
can select all parameters and control the spines’ geometry
complexity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average tissue volume fraction occupied by astroglia and
neurons, as distributed radially from the soma to the cell edges, is
also required. This data set can be obtained from two-photon
excitation measurements in situ (or from published data).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to have the mean membrane surface density and
surface-to-volume fraction values, which can be obtained from 3D
reconstructions of nanoscopic processes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The characteristic I-V curve for the cell of interest, obtained
through somatic patch-clamp with square-pulse current injections, is
essential. Other available functional data, such as electrical
responses to neurotransmitter uncaging or changes in extracellular
ion and intracellular calcium wave speed, are optional but helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> <strong>As detailed in the text, control windows are initiated
by launching NEURON in the BrainCell environment. The file init.hoc
opens three windows: System window (cmd.exe) (a), a window panel to
define the gross astrocyte geometry (stem tree, b), and a menu panel to
set the density for higher orders of nanoscopic processes ('Leaf

<h2 id="generatingdownloading-astrocyte-stem-tree">Generating/downloading astrocyte stem tree</h2>

<p>To design a new astrocyte model, the user has to define the basic
structure of a dendritic tree using three different options:</p>

<p><strong>Option</strong> <strong>1</strong>: Click on "Select Library Stem Tree".</p>

<p>Choose to import 3D files in general zip format from the database
<em>http://neuromorpho.com</em>. You can upload as many files as you like, but
for convenience, placing them in the directory, /Geometry/Astrocyte/New
Style is recommended.</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/image12.png" alt="" width="77.74%" height="25.53%" /><img src="assets/media/image13.png" alt="" width="77.74%" height="25.53%" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4. Importing 3D Cell Structure. A) The web page of NeuroMorpho
displays the 3D shape of a cell. B) Operational BRAINCELL panels
providing options to select astroglia morphology.</strong></p>

<p>Alternatively, select a file from the in-house directory
…\BrainCell\Geometry\ in SCW or HOC format.</p>

<p>To view a 3D structure of a file, please follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Select the desired file that contains a 3D structure, pressing
“<strong>Select library stem tree</strong>”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will be directed to a new window to view the 3D geometry of the
selected file and choose the “<strong>Astrocyte/New Style</strong>” directory and
file with 3D structure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you like the structure, click the "Use this" button to proceed
to the next step.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you do not like the structure, you can select another one by
clicking the "Import another" button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have chosen the desired 3D structure, you can proceed to
the next option by clicking the appropriate “<strong>Use this</strong>” button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OriginalDendrite sets the number of branches (dendrites in NEURON
terminology) on the stem tree. The database <strong><em>NeuroMorpho.org</em></strong>
can be used as a guide to the ASTRO-compatible file format. Upon
selection, a window panel displays the selected stem tree (<strong>Fig.
5a</strong>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you press "<strong>Use this</strong>" but change your mind later, don't worry;
making a new selection is simple. Press the "Select Library Stem Tree"
button again or choose "<strong>Select Stem Tree with Endfoot</strong>" from the
options. If you are confident in your choice, press the final "Start
Astro" key. Once you press it, you will not be able to go back.</p>

<p><em>Another option is to import the 3D geometry.</em></p>

<p>1<strong>. Editing the Endfoot Geometry:</strong></p>

<p>A popup window will appear if you select the "Select Stem Tree with
Endfoot" option. This window allows you to modify the geometry of the
endfoot (refer to Fig. 5B), providing a menu to set the morphology of
the main and the secondary endfoot branches and the local biophysical
mechanisms.</p>

<p>2 <strong>'Select</strong> <strong>reconstructed</strong> <strong>stem</strong> <strong>tree’</strong> loads the
3D-reconstructed stem tree file. An example in
<strong><em>RealAstrocyteSkeleton1.hoc</em></strong> (the directory …<em>/Geometry</em>) shows
the reconstructed stem tree of the CA1 astrocyte using the Vaa3D
software (Allen Institute, available from</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/research/products-tools/vaa3d/)">http://www.alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/research/products-tools/vaa3d/)</a>.</p>

<p>This option also prompts an additional window panel (Fig. 17d),
providing a setting for geometrical scaling and the centring of the
astrocyte structure at the coordinate origin (to facilitate the
positioning of selected cell compartments). The corresponding menu
buttons thus include '<strong>X-Y</strong> <strong>scale</strong> <strong>(pixel/μm)</strong>', '<strong>Z</strong>
<strong>scale</strong> <strong>(pixel</strong> <strong>μm)</strong>', and '<strong>X-Y</strong> s<strong>hift</strong> <strong>(μm)</strong>'. This
window will disappear after any parameter change.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Regardless of the case, a popup window directs you to the
directory where the 3D file should be located. Make sure you have
downloaded the required geometry file in advance using Neuromorphic.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Adding Nano Geometry to the Astrocytic Tree:</strong></p>

<p>Once you have finalised the 3D geometry of the astrocyte, you have the
option to incorporate nano geometry into the structure. To achieve this,
you can use a file containing nano geometry that you have prepared using
the Astro package. Select the "Select Diameter Distribution for Nano
Geometry" option or press the "Start Astro" key. The BrainCell module
will generate the astrocyte geometry randomly while ensuring it adheres
to primary physiological constraints.</p>

<p>We recommend using the "<strong>Start Astro</strong>" key when initially
acquainting yourself with the software program. This will help you
familiarise yourself with its functionalities and capabilities.</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/image16.png" alt="" width="38.98%" height="38.49%" /><img src="assets/media/image17.png" alt="" width="33.77%" height="34.52%" /><img src="assets/media/image18.png" alt="" width="38.98%" height="22.01%" /><img src="assets/media/image19.png" alt="" width="29.31%" height="21.03%" /><img src="assets/media/image20.png" alt="" width="22.61%" height="16.58%" /></p>

"Biophysical Mechanisms" section can be used to add new cell
mechanisms to this part. C) Panel for exporting the 3D structure of the
cell. D) Panel for transforming 3D shape. These panels are essential for
manipulating and generating astroglial morphology in three dimensions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Before proceeding with further model design, the user must
upload the cell stem tree geometry to the designated GEOMETRY directory.</p>

<h3 id="the-geometry-of-nanoscopic-processes">The geometry of nanoscopic processes</h3>

<p>Once the stem tree has been downloaded, the next stage is the
nanostructure of the astrocyte. The user has two options on the popup
window (see below), highlighted in yellow.</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/image26.png" alt="" width="21.88%" height="26.59%" /></p>

<p><strong>Option</strong> <strong>1:</strong> To download the default nanostructure prepared in
advance. Pressing the button <strong>'Diameter</strong> <strong>distribution</strong> <strong>for</strong>
<strong>nano-geometry'</strong> prompts the user to download a file with the
statistics of process diameters produced by the '<strong>Nano</strong>
<strong>(Geometry)'</strong> module from the sampled 3D-reconstructed astroglial
processes (see above). By default, this option downloads the file
<strong><em>testshape.dat_radii_dist.txt</em></strong> (characterising astroglial processes
in CA1 <em>stratum</em> <em>radiatum</em>). After that, the user presses the
'<strong>Start</strong> <strong>Astro’</strong> button.</p>

<p><strong>Option</strong> <strong>2:</strong> To press the '<strong>Start</strong> <strong>Astro’</strong> button, in which
case BrainCell generates nanoscopic processes automatically using the
built-in tools.</p>

<p>In both cases, the user can repeatedly adjust key morphometric features
of the generated nanostructures. See further details in the chapter
<strong>Simulating</strong> <strong>Astrocyte</strong> <strong>Physiology</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="populating-astrocyte-tree-with-nanoscopic-processes">Populating astrocyte tree with nanoscopic processes</h3>

<p>The '<strong>Start</strong> <strong>Astro’</strong> button prompts the main window panel
'<strong>Repertoire</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>computation</strong>', critical to modelling
complete astrocyte morphology, as described in the sections below.</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/image27.png" alt="" width="22.97%" height="32.04%" /></p>

for customizing astrocyte geometry.</em></p>

<p><em>b) <strong>Simulated Variable:</strong> The simulated variable is visually
represented on the astrocyte morphology, with the top portion showing
the mapping of variables (e.g., membrane voltage) and the bottom
showcasing a selected digital output plot.</em></p>

<p><em>c) <strong>Biophysics, Stochastic, and Extracellular Sources Settings:</strong> This
section encompasses settings related to biophysical characteristics,
stochastic elements, and extracellular sources. It's also where you
configure computational scenarios with parameter adjustments.</em></p>

<p><em>d) <strong>Nanostructure Placement:</strong> Users can define the location of
nanostructures on the basic dendritic morphology, choosing to position
them either throughout the entire astrocyte or exclusively on local
dendrites.</em></p>

<p><em>e) <strong>Nanostructure Density Distribution:</strong> This part allows you to set
the density distribution of nanostructures, offering options for both
uniform and non-uniform arrangements. These settings significantly
impact the distribution and behaviour of nanostructures within the
astrocyte.</em></p>

<p>One of the essential features for managing nano geometry is a key
located in the upper left corner of the main window (Fig.6 A). This
option enables the creation of nano geometry exclusively in a specific
location within the dendritic tree. To utilise this feature, follow the
steps outlined below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Switching from "<strong>All dendrites</strong>" to "<strong>Some dendrites</strong>"
option: By toggling this option, you can restrict the nano geometry
creation to specific dendrites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initiating the "<strong>Reseed</strong>" process: Press the designated
"<strong>Reseed</strong>" key to activate this process. This action will prompt
an additional window to appear, providing further customisation
options for the placement of the nano geometry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifying the desired location: In the newly opened window, you can
specify where to add the nano geometry. This level of control allows
you to target specific areas within the dendritic tree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Selecting dendrites: Select the desired dendrites in the window.
This step involves identifying the dendrites where you intend to
generate an astrocyte with localised nanostructures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finalizing the process: After selecting the desired dendrites, press
the "Done" key to generate the astrocyte with the specified
nanostructures localised to the chosen dendrites.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: This option will increase computational requirements, mainly when
focusing on very localised processes within the astrocyte. It is
beneficial for users who are interested in studying fine-grained details
within the astrocyte's local environment.</p>

<p>Panel '<strong>Leaf</strong> <strong>Geometry'</strong> (Fig. 6a, top) provides an option to set
up the distribution of cylindrical compartments (leaves) of nanoscopic
processes as evenly random (with lower and upper limits) when the
experimental statistics on 3D reconstructed processes are not available.</p>

<p>NOTE: This section will be ignored when the latter has already been
loaded (see previous section).</p>

<p>Panel '<strong>Stalk</strong> <strong>Geometry'</strong> (Fig. 6a, middle) sets upper and lower
limits for the uniform distribution of transitional cylinders of nano
geometry. These parameters determine how densely the tissue will be
filled with nanoscopic astroglial processes.</p>

<p>Panel <strong>'Specific</strong> <strong>membrane</strong> <strong>conductance'</strong> sets this value at
the button '<strong>Gm</strong> <strong>(mS/cm2</strong>)', which considers all exposed surfaces
of the cylindrical compartments. The resting potential of the current is
-85 mV. This parameter is defined on the built-in NEURON panel
“Distributed mechanism”.</p>

<p>Panel <strong>'Dendritic</strong> <strong>Geometry'</strong> (Fig. 6a, bottom) currently
includes <strong>'Branch</strong> <strong>diameter</strong> <strong>scaling',</strong> which sets the scaling
coefficient for the stem tree branch diameters as a function of distance
from the soma, according to the average experimental trend. The
empirically established formula for the branch diameter <em>d</em> is
<em>d</em>~(<em>S</em>(<em>r+1</em>))-1/2 where <strong>'scalingDiam'</strong> value S and <em>r</em> is the
distance to the soma.</p>

<p><strong>Customizing Cell Geometry</strong></p>

<p>For more profound alterations to the cell's geometry, you have the
option to access advanced settings. By selecting "Edit Biophysics" and
"Edit Morphology," you gain the ability to modify the morphology of
any cell component based on the distance from the soma, following any
mathematical rules of your choice. This level of customization empowers
you to craft intricate and tailored cell structures to suit your
specific research or simulation needs.</p>

<p>NOTE: This panel has to be ignored if a 3D-reconstructed stem tree has
been uploaded.</p>

<h3 id="tissue-filling-properties-of-astroglial-morphology">Tissue-filling properties of astroglial morphology</h3>

<p>The tissue volume-filling properties and the surface-to-volume ratios of
the nanoscopic processes will be determined by the shapes and the
effective density of simulated nanoscopic processes, as described in the
previous section. Tissue volume filling and other geometry features of
the model can be monitored by pressing the <strong>'Geometrical</strong>
<strong>parameters'</strong> key (Fig. 6): this opens several window panels
displaying various parameters of the modelled cell geometry (Fig. 7).
The displayed data are automatically saved to the file
<strong><em>…\neuronSims\Text</em></strong> <strong><em>results\VolumFraction.txt</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Below are the key features of the main window:</p>

<h3 id="geometric-parameters-button">"Geometric parameters" button</h3>

<p>The "Geometric parameters" button allows you to calculate graphs of
the main geometric parameters of the cell.</p>

fraction, total cell volume (cumulative value with the distance from the
soma), total cell surface area, and diameters of primary processes.</p>

<p>The morphometric characteristics of the simulated astrocyte (Fig. 7) are
to be compared with the corresponding empirical data obtained using 3D
EM reconstructions and two-photon excitation imaging data for the
astroglia of interest. The user can evaluate the mismatch and adjust the
density of nanoscopic processes (using '<strong>Stalk</strong> <strong>Geometry'</strong> and
'<strong>Dendritic</strong> <strong>Geometry'</strong> options where relevant; Fig. 6)
correspondingly until an acceptable match is produced. The windows
depicting critical geometrical parameters (Fig. 7) can be viewed anytime
during modelling.</p>

<p>At the end of this stage, the modelled astroglial morphology is complete
(see 'FRAP experiments' below for further subtle morphological
adjustments). The user can begin to simulate various astroglia functions
while implementing various membrane and intracellular biophysical

<h2 id="importing-and-generating-complete-neuron-morphology">IMPORTING AND GENERATING COMPLETE NEURON MORPHOLOGY</h2>

<p>In this section, we will describe the <strong>BRAINCELL</strong> part specifically
designed for constructing a 3D geometry model of a neuron. Please note
that this part is different from the one used for astrocytes. When you
load a 3D neuron, you will be presented with two windows that will allow
you to determine the critical features of the neuron's structure. The
first window will enable you to set the maximum number of spines on the
dendrite (Fig.9A and B). These windows are critical and can be changed
in the future, along with the geometry of the spines.</p>

<p>To accurately represent all parts of a cell, you can use the window
shown in Figure 9C. It helps you identify the neuron's soma, dendrites,
and axon. If the axon is not defined, the program can generate a basic
one, or you can select one from a different section. You can edit the
geometrical parameters later. Ensure each component has a unique name;
otherwise, the software will show an error message. To create a 3D
neuron, select your preferred configuration and click OK. The program
will generate the form you have chosen, which you can use to assemble
other neuron models or try another form from the database.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 9. Import, Selection, and Final Shape of the 3D Structure of a
Nerve Cell. A) Cell Structure Definition Panel: This crucial panel
empowers users to define the cell's soma, dendrites, and axon. Future
updates allow users to customize geometry vocabulary and organise
dendrites into subgroups. B) Cell Shape Selection Panel: This panel
provides options to select the desired final shape of the cell. C) Spine
Density Control Panel: This panel adjusts the maximum number of spines
per dendrite. It should be noted that larger dendrites generally exhibit
lower spine density. In future iterations, users will have the ability
to modify spine density.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fig. 9</strong> illustrates the process of importing, selecting and shaping a
3D structure of a nerve cell. Panels demonstrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the import process, where the user can identify the soma, dendrite
or axon and determine the maximum number of spines on the longest
dendrite,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>displays the selected structure, enabling the user to accept or
import another structure for viewing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This figure provides a visual representation of the crucial steps
involved in the process of constructing a 3D model of a nerve cell. If
the user decides to try another neuron morphology, the procedure must be
repeated, as previously described. If the user decides to stop at this
one, a new window will appear by pressing the "<strong>Use this one</strong>"
button.</p>

<p>Using <strong>BrainCell</strong>, users can customise the geometry and morphology of
neurons by selecting the desired parameters and pressing the "<strong>use
this Neuron</strong>" button. This will open the main window, providing access
to various functions that can improve the cell's geometry, visualise
any changes, and begin incorporating various biophysical mechanisms with
different spatial distributions and stochastic properties.</p>

<p>In Fig.10's window, users can adjust cell geometry and test biophysical
mechanisms to understand neuron actions better.</p>

<p>Our software provides users with a powerful tool to customise and
analyse neurons' geometry and biophysical properties, all within an
easy-to-use interface.</p>

<p>[It is crucial to note that while setting biophysical mechanisms, users
can combine different parts of cells, such as the neck and heads of
spines, which can be referred to as just a spine. Alternatively, users
can divide dendrites, for example, into proximal and distal
dendrites.]{.underline}</p>

<p><strong>Figure 12. Spine Geometry Modification Panel</strong></p>

<p><strong>A) Main Panel of Spine Geometry: This central panel provides options
and controls for modifying the geometry of spines within the dendritic
tree. B) Panel for Uniform Distribution: This sub-panel is dedicated to
achieving a uniform distribution of spines across the dendritic tree,
offering precise control over their arrangement. C) Panel for
Non-Uniform Distribution: In this sub-panel, spines are distributed
non-uniformly using a user-defined formula, allowing for customized and
intricate spine arrangements.</strong></p>

<p>This part explains how to use the tool to analyse the geometry
distribution of dendritic spines (Fig.12). The panel provides two
distribution options, regular and uniform, allowing the user to set
numerical parameters for each distribution via a window upon selection.
The tool also considers the minimum distance between synapses in a
dendritic tree as an essential parameter for synapse distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Selecting a Distribution:</strong></p>

<p>To use the tool, the user must first select a distribution type. There
are two options available: regular and uniform. The user can select a
distribution type by clicking on the respective button on the panel
(Fig.12). Once the user has selected a distribution type, they can set
numerical parameters for each distribution via a window that appears
upon selection.</p>

<p><strong>Using Pre-Established Distribution Types:</strong></p>

<p>The tool provides pre-established distribution types of spine geometry
to make it more convenient for the user. These pre-established
distribution types have been published in Tønnesen, J., Katona, G.,
Rózsa, B. et al. Spine neck plasticity regulates the
compartmentalisation of synapses. Nat Neurosci 17, 678–685 (2014).
https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3682. To use these pre-established
distribution types, the user can click on the respective button on the
panel. This will provide the user with experiment-measured parameters
for the selected distribution type.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting Spine Complexity:</strong></p>

<p>Another crucial factor in determining spines is their spatial complexity
(number of segments), which affects calculation speed. The number of
segments can be adjusted with a minimum of two and no maximum limit. The
user can adjust the complexity parameter using the panel slider.</p>

<p><strong>Defining Synapse Distance:</strong></p>

<p>The tool also considers the distance between synapses within a dendritic
tree, which is a crucial factor for synapse distribution. You can
control this distance in uniform and non-uniform ways, as shown in Fig.
12.B and C. The distance parameter is inherently stochastic, which means
the tool incorporates an element of chance in its calculations. Users
can adjust the minimum distance between synapses using the provided
panels. For the non-uniform distribution of synapse distances in the
spatial domain, users can create a custom Python-format formula in a
single line and apply it by clicking the "Apply" button. This feature
allows for precise control over the spatial arrangement of synapses
within the dendritic tree, accommodating random and user-defined
patterns.</p>

<p><strong><em>In conclusion, this tool allows users to analyse the geometry
distribution of dendritic spines. The tool offers two distribution
options, regular and uniform, which the user can select. The user can
set numerical parameters for each distribution via a window upon
selection. The tool also considers the minimum distance between synapses
in a dendritic tree as an essential parameter for synapse distribution.
Users can adjust the minimum distance between synapses and the
complexity parameter to suit their requirements.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="manager-of-biophysical-mechanisms">Manager of biophysical mechanisms.</h2>

<p>The tool enables users to add and change various biophysical mechanisms
to neurons to investigate their impact on neuron behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Upon clicking</strong> the "<strong>Manage the distance of Mechanisms</strong>" button
located in the upper right corner (<strong>Figure 10. <a href="#MainWindowNeuronsimulation">Main
Window</a></strong>), the user shall be presented
with two significant panels, as depicted in (<strong>Figure 10</strong>).</p>

<p>Instructions for the software panel Fig.14:</p>

<p>The software panel comprises two windows: the first (A) and the second
(B).</p>

<p><strong>Operating with Cell Compartments and Mechanisms in Window A:</strong></p>

<p>In Window A, users can perform various operations on cell compartments
and mechanisms to tailor their simulation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Compartment Operations:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Splitting and Merging Compartments:</strong> Users can split one area
into two or merge two areas into one. Additionally, renaming
compartments is possible for enhanced organisation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rescanning Model for Additional Mechanisms:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Deep Rescan:</strong> When adding extra areas to the cell (excluding
from the BrainCell list), a deep rescan must include the changes
effectively.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Light Rescan:</strong> A light rescan is essential for proper
integration after adding extra mechanisms not listed in the
BrainCell.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Export and Import Options:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Export to JSON:</strong> Users can create a JSON-format file
containing biophysical mechanism data for future use or sharing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Import from JSON:</strong> Previously saved mechanisms can be
imported conveniently and efficiently.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These functionalities in Window A provide users with powerful tools to
manage and enhance their simulation by modifying compartments,
incorporating additional mechanisms, and maintaining a library of
biophysical mechanisms for streamlined future use. </p>

<p><strong>Figure 14. Panels for Biophysical Mechanisms Management</strong></p>

<p><strong>(A) Manager of Distributed Mechanisms Panel:</strong></p>

<p><strong>This panel facilitates efficient operation with compartments and
mechanisms. Users can seamlessly work with various mechanisms in
specific cell areas, add or divide different areas, and scan and enhance
mechanism distribution. It also offers the flexibility to export/import
different mechanisms, enhancing usability and customisation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Users can swiftly utilize the "Apply" button to add selected
mechanisms to the designated area. The down button allows users to
switch between an area-centric and a mechanism-centric view, providing
an adaptable interface for managing mechanisms effectively.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Window (B and C): Inserting and Removing Mechanisms and Cell-Part
Operations</strong></p>

<p>Window (B and C) is a pivotal tool that empowers users to manage and
interact with mechanisms within specific regions of the brain cell (B)
and specific mechanisms within different cell regions (C). Here's a
breakdown of its features and functionalities:</p>

<ol>

    <ul>
      <li>Users can effortlessly choose desired mechanisms by selecting
corresponding checkboxes, tailoring the simulation to their
needs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cell-Part Operations:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subgrouping, Merging, and Renaming:</strong> Enables users to perform

      <li>
        <p><strong>Stochastic Mechanism Analysis:</strong> Facilitates analysis of
stochastic mechanisms, providing insights into their behaviour
within the simulation.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Window (B and C) is a comprehensive interface essential for managing
mechanisms within specific brain cell regions and performing crucial
cell-part operations. Users can seamlessly interact with, analyse, and
modify mechanisms to achieve desired simulation outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="adjust-the-spatial-distribution-of-mechanisms">Adjust the spatial distribution of mechanisms.</h3>

<p>The central panel (<strong>Figure 15</strong>) adjusts the spatial distribution of
the mechanism across any part of the cell, allowing the user different
options to define the mathematical formula for the spatial distribution.</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/image56.png" alt="" width="91.02%" height="46.87%" /><img src="assets/media/image57.png" alt="" width="91.02%" height="46.87%" /><img src="assets/media/image58.png" alt="" width="91.02%" height="46.87%" /><img src="assets/media/image59.jpeg" alt="" width="91.02%" height="46.87%" /></p>

<h2 id="synapse-distribution">Synapse distribution.</h2>

<p>The tool facilitates the addition and distribution of different types of
synapses on the dendritic tree, enabling the study of the neuron's
connectivity and behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 15: Panels for adding spatial properties to biophysical
mechanisms in a cell. A) Mechanism Selection Panel: Users can select a
biophysical mechanism and choose to modify its spatial. B) Spatial
Property Definition Panel: Users can define the spatial properties of
the selected parameters or variables. C) Examples Panel: Displays
examples of the types of parameters and variables that can be modified
for each biophysical mechanism. D) Spatial Model Activation Panel: Users
can enable the spatial properties of the selected parameter or variable
by pressing the "Define as a function " button.</strong></p>

<p>The main interface (Fig.15A) is accurately designed to integrate with
the various biophysical mechanisms in different parts of the neuron.
Each segment of the neuron is conveniently located within its respective
window in the main interface, containing all the biophysical mechanisms
associated with it.</p>

<p>To change any mechanism, click on it, and a menu will pop up
(Fig.15<strong>C</strong>), allowing you to select the desired editing options. This
menu includes choices for global variables, state variables, and
parameters. For more in-depth information about a selected variable,
click on any of these options to access a separate window (Fig.15D).</p>

<p>In the new window, you'll see the current value of the variable if
it's spatially homogeneous. If you want to make it spatially
inhomogeneous, click the "<strong>Define as a function of distance</strong>" bar.
Doing this will open a new window called the Heterogeneity Editor
(Fig.15B).</p>

<p>In the <strong>Heterogeneity Editor</strong>, you can define the variable as a
function of distance. This allows you to customise the properties of the
variable based on the spatial location. Once you've described it, you
can save your changes (Apply button) and edit other mechanisms.</p>

<h3 id="spatial-inhomogeneity-of-biophysical-mechanisms-editor">Spatial Inhomogeneity of Biophysical Mechanisms Editor.</h3>

<p>This editor (Fig.15B) allows us to work with neuron segments to
determine the mechanisms' heterogeneity.</p>

<p>The editor's main window is divided into three parts. The upper part of
the panel is where you can work with segments of neuron parts. This is a
crucial part of the software because heterogeneity is determined not in
each physical coordinate of the neuron but in each segment.</p>

<p>For example, if your dendrite has only one segment, no matter how long
it is, it will be spatially non-uniform. Therefore, you must increase
the number of segments for more detailed spatial heterogeneity. However,
it should be noted that the more segments you have, the longer the
calculation will take.</p>

<h3 id="the-spatial-inhomogeneity-specification-feature-of-the-software">The spatial inhomogeneity specification feature of the software.</h3>

<p>This feature allows you to specify the spatial inhomogeneity of a
selected mechanism in your simulation. To use this feature, navigate to
the central part of the window. Here, you will find the panel that
offers five different modes for specifying the spatial inhomogeneity of
your mechanism. Let's take a look at each of these modes:</p>

<p><strong>Simple Model</strong>:</p>

<p>This mode offers several options to specify the spatial inhomogeneity of
your mechanism. You can choose a constant value for the spatial
inhomogeneity or specify a linear, quadratic, or polynomial function
with two, three, or more parameters. You can also choose an exponential
function for the spatial inhomogeneity.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Function</strong>:</p>

<p>If you have a specific function in mind that is not covered by the
options in the Simple Model mode, you can use the Custom Function mode.
Here, you can enter any function you like, as long as it is written in
either the neuron language or Python. To set your custom function, use
the pop-up window.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Function from File</strong>:</p>

<p>In addition to the Custom Function mode, you can specify a custom
function from a file. This option allows you to define your function in
a separate file, written in either Neuron or Python. Once you have
created your file, you can specify it in the software and use it to
specify the spatial inhomogeneity of your mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Table Function</strong>:</p>

<p>If you have experimental data that you would like to use to specify the
spatial inhomogeneity of your mechanism, you can use the Table Function
mode. This mode allows you to download your data either manually or as a
text file and use it to specify the spatial inhomogeneity.</p>

<p><strong>Special Function</strong>:</p>

<p>Finally, the "Special Function" option displays sections and the
distribution of segments within the neuron cell. You have control over
the cell model's discretisation stage. The discretisation is depicted
on the cell's spatial graph. The segments are marked differently for
better visualisation.</p>

<h3 id="visualisation-of-spatial-heterogeneity">Visualisation of Spatial Heterogeneity</h3>

<p>This part provides two different ways to visualise spatial
heterogeneity. To access these options, navigate to the lower part of
the main panel.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1</strong>: Heterogeneity as the Distance from the Soma. With this
option, you can visualise the degree of spatial heterogeneity related to
the Distance from the Soma. This visualisation can help you identify
areas of the neuron that exhibit high or low heterogeneity. To use this
option, select it from the main panel.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2</strong>: Spatial Colour map of Inhomogeneity on a cell. This option
lets you visualise spatial heterogeneity using a colour gradient
representing the cell's inhomogeneity degree. The colours range from
cold to warm, with colder colours indicating lower levels of
inhomogeneity and warmer colours indicating higher levels. To use this
option, select it from the main panel.</p>

<p>Both of these visualisation options can provide valuable insights into
the spatial heterogeneity of your neuron. Choose the option that best
suits your needs and explore the heterogeneity of your neuron in new and
insightful ways.</p>

<h2 id="adjust-the-stochastic-distribution-of-mechanisms">Adjust the stochastic distribution of mechanisms.</h2>

<p>The central panel (<strong>Figure 16</strong>) adjusts the stochastic properties of
the mechanism across any part of the cell, allowing the user different
options to define the mathematical formula for the stochastic
distribution.</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/image56.png" alt="" width="74.95%" height="44.65%" /><img src="assets/media/image57.png" alt="" width="74.95%" height="44.65%" /><img src="assets/media/image60.jpeg" alt="" width="74.95%" height="44.65%" /><img src="assets/media/image63.png" alt="" width="74.95%" height="44.65%" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 16: Panels for adding stochastic properties to biophysical
mechanisms in a cell. A) Mechanism Selection Panel: Users can select a
biophysical mechanism and choose to modify its stochastic properties.</strong></p>

<p><strong>B) Stochastic Property Definition Panel: Users can define the
stochastic properties of the selected mechanism's parameters or
variables.</strong></p>

<p><strong>C) Examples Panel: Displays examples of the types of parameters and
variables that can be modified for each biophysical mechanism.</strong></p>

<p><strong>D) Stochastic Model Activation Panel: Users can enable the stochastic
properties of the selected parameter or variable by pressing the
"Define stochastic model" button.</strong></p>

<p>To begin editing any mechanism, click on it. This will bring up a menu
where you can select what you want to edit. The menu includes options
for global variables, state variables, and parameters. You can access
another window that provides more detailed information about the
selected variable by clicking on any of these options.</p>

<p>In the new window, you'll see the current value of the variable if
it's spatially homogeneous and “nan” is spatial non–uniform. To make
this mechanism stochastic, click the "<strong>Define as a stochastic
model</strong>" bar. Doing this will open a new window called the
<strong>Stochasticity Editor</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="stochasticity-editor">Stochasticity Editor</h3>

<p>You can define the variable as a different stochastic function in the
Stochasticity Editor. This allows you to customise the behaviour of the
variable as a stochastic function in time. Once you've described it,
you can save your changes and edit other mechanisms.</p>

<p>The <strong>Stochasticity Editor</strong> window has four parts to help you model and
visualise different stochastic distributions for a given variable.
Let's go through each part in detail.</p>

<p>1)  <strong>Upper Part</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a.  *Left part*: This part shows information about the state,
    "**Inhomogeneous**" of stochasticity of this variable/parameter,
    "**Mechanisms**", its location on the cell," Compartment", and
    full name with units, "**PARAMETER**". It also indicates whether
    this variable/parameter is spatially inhomogeneous.

b.  *Right part "**Bounding**"*: Here you can select the parametric
    domain of (**DF**) density function of the stochastic variable,
    either non-infinite "**Keep as is**", from above "**Bound from

    "**Bound from both sides**". The full definition of any mode is
    on the right of the panel.

<h2 id="manager-of-synapses">Manager of synapses.</h2>

<p>The following information is vital for those who wish to create synaptic
inputs.</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/image64.png" alt="" width="79.55%" height="59.76%" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 17. The Synaptic Simulations. A) Panel of Alternative Run
Simulation for Stochastic Variables: The panel demonstrate alternative
run simulations for stochastic variables within the synaptic
environment. B) Panel of Manager of Synaptic and Presynaptic Mechanisms:
The manager acts as a central control system, orchestrating the
interactions between different synaptic elements and ensuring efficient
communication within the neural network (Details in the text).</strong></p>

<p>The synaptic panel (Fig.17B) produces and distributes distinct synaptic
inputs throughout a dendritic tree. The number of spines on the
dendritic tree determines the number of synapses without excess or
deficiency. To modify the distribution and density of spines, one must
use the main panel (Fig.10). Please note that the number of spines
(synapses) on the synaptic panel (Fig.17B) cannot be altered. However,
with this panel, users can relocate synapses, either on the spine itself
or near it on the dendrite. The distribution of synapses may vary in
proportions, with some distributed over the spines and others located
close to them. When a synapse is near a spine, the spine's conductance
becomes zero, essentially disappearing in an electrical sense. However,
if the synapse is situated on a spine, it functions as a full-fledged
conductor. When a spine is positioned next to the synapse, it can affect
synaptic function.</p>

<p>Note. To compute the synaptic release probability, use the
<strong>AltRunControl</strong> and indicate the key “<strong>Enable stochasticity.</strong>”</p>

<p>This <strong>Synaptic panel</strong> (Fig.17B) is designed to give users a
comprehensive understanding of the synapse's role. To get started, look
at the upper portion of the panel. You'll find important information
and tools to manipulate the location of synapses. The <strong>Synaptic panel</strong>
has three parts to help you model and visualise different synaptic
distributions and efficacy types.</p>

<p>Let's go through each part in detail.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="#synaptic-manager-upper-part."><strong>Synaptic manager</strong> <strong>upper

  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="synaptic-manager-upper-part">Synaptic manager “upper part”.</h4>

<p>####</p>

<p>The information section in the upper portion of the panel is where you
can find valuable data about the synapses on the dendritic tree. This
section will indicate the number of synapses distributed throughout the
dendritic tree, including the spatial range and whether the parameters
are spatially homogeneous. Additionally, it will provide you with
stochastic variables of its parameters, which is crucial for
understanding the behaviour of the synapses.</p>

<p>To change the location of the synapses on spines or dendrites, use the
tools located in the upper right portion of the panel. By manipulating
these tools, you can adjust the position of the synapses to your desired
location.</p>

<p>The “<strong>Synapse location</strong>” button opens a pop-up panel (<strong>Fig.18A</strong>).</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/image66.png" alt="" width="58.70%" height="62.99%" /><img src="assets/media/image68.png" alt="" width="58.70%" height="62.99%" /><img src="assets/media/image69.png" alt="" width="58.70%" height="62.99%" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 18: Pop-Up Panels of Synaptic Manager. A) shows the synaptic
location manager, allowing users to visualise the spatial distribution
of synapses. B) displays the manager of presynaptic signals, which
provides information about the presynaptic neuron's activity. C)
presents the manager of synaptic parameters, where users can modify
synaptic properties such as strength and plasticity. D) shows the
manager of presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms, located in the
mechanism directory, which enables users to customise the synaptic
transmission and reception mechanisms.</strong></p>

<p>This part guides you through this panel's upper and lower (<strong>Fig.18A</strong>)
parts and helps you understand their functionalities.</p>

<p><strong>Upper Part:</strong> The upper part of the “<strong>Synapse location</strong>” panel
enables you to modify the location of the synapses. There are three
options available on this panel that you can use to change the location
of synapses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Place all synapses on the spines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Place synapses on dendrites at the location of spines</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Place synapses on dendrites and spines in different proportions</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can select any of the above options according to your requirements,
and the software will make the necessary changes accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Lower Part</strong>: The lower part of the Synapse panel contains
informational data and two buttons: "<strong>Apply</strong>" and "<strong>Review after
Apply.</strong>"</p>

<p>The informational data in the lower part provides details about the
synapses' current location and density. It also shows the changes made
to the synapse location after selecting any options mentioned in the
upper part of the panel.</p>

<p>The " <strong>Apply</strong> " button confirms the changes made to the synapse
location and saves them in the software. If you do not wish to save the
changes, click the "Cancel" button.</p>

<p>The " <strong>Review after Apply</strong> " button lets you see how the program
changed the synapse location. This option lets you verify the changes
and ensure they align with your requirements.</p>

<h3 id="synaptic-structure">Synaptic structure.</h3>

<h4 id="synaptic-manager-top-part-figure-18-b">Synaptic manager “top part” (<strong>Figure 18 B</strong>).</h4>

<p>This part creates synaptic structures in the neuronal model <strong>(Figure
18) Synaptic panel (B)</strong>. Synapses are two types in "<strong>BrainCell</strong>",
one that requires a presynaptic signal and the other that works without
a presynaptic signal. The second type turns on depending on the
"<strong>onset</strong>" parameter.</p>

<p>The panel (<strong>Fig. 18</strong>) offers two synaptic structures to accommodate
these two types. The first structure includes presynaptic and
postsynaptic mechanisms (<strong>Source PP NetCon Target PP Section</strong>), while
the second includes only postsynaptic mechanisms (<strong>Source PP
Section</strong>). Selecting one of these scenarios allows you to get either
postsynaptic or presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms in the middle
panel.</p>

<p>Please note that you cannot use the "probability of release" parameter
if you choose only the presynaptic option (<strong>Source PP NetCon Target PP
Section</strong>).</p>

<h4 id="synaptic-manager-middle-part">Synaptic manager “middle part”</h4>

<p>This middle section of the panel (Fig. 18 B) has been specifically
designed to allow you to organise and manipulate the presynaptic and
postsynaptic functions of synapses with various parameters. Here, you
can choose different presynaptic mechanisms (left panel – Source PP)
and connect them to the synaptic mechanism (right panel – Target PP).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Mechanism Panels</strong>:</em></p>

  <p><em>The user interface displays two panels: the left panel showcasing
mechanisms associated with presynaptic function and the right panel
presenting mechanisms associated with synaptic function. These panels
provide access to NEURON mechanisms and unique mechanisms in the
BrainCell directory.</em></p>

  <p><em><strong>Finding Unique Mechanisms</strong>:</em></p>

  <p><em>If you cannot locate a specific unique mechanism in the panel, you
can utilise the "<strong>Adjust lists filter</strong>" feature. A new popup
window will appear by pressing this unique key, allowing you to apply
specific filters. The filtering functionality lets you refine your
search and view all possible point mechanisms within the BrainCell
mechanisms folder. In (<strong>Figure 18</strong>), two panels are depicted, each
showcasing a different level of filtering. This feature lets you
quickly identify and insert unique mechanisms into your neuronal model
based on your requirements.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have selected the appropriate presynaptic and postsynaptic
mechanisms, you can start modifying the set of parameters by clicking on
the buttons labelled “<strong>Edit source PP vars</strong>” and “<strong>Edit target PP
vars</strong>”.</p>

<p>The modification of the spatial distribution of Point base
(<strong>Synaptic</strong>) mechanisms follows the same rules as the modification of
the spatial distribution of standard density mechanisms, as explained in
the section. <a href="#manager-of-biophysical-mechanisms.">Manage distribution
mechanisms.</a></p>

<p>The randomness of synaptic parameters changes specifically when the
presynaptic signal is generated, as opposed to the randomness of
spatially distributed mechanisms. This means the synapse's stochastic
events only occur when the presynaptic signal is generated or when the
"onset" time parameter value is reached. However, the panel for
controlling stochasticity is no different from that for spatial
mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>**User Manual Note:**</strong></p>

<p>It's crucial to highlight that within this mode (<strong>Source PP
Section</strong>), users can incorporate various point mechanisms. These may
include adding an electrode in the potential fixation mode or applying
an external current—virtually any modification defined as a localised
alteration in current or potential can be introduced in this context.</p>

<p><strong>*********************</strong></p>

<h4 id="synaptic-manager-bottom-part">Synaptic manager “bottom part”.</h4>

<p>To manipulate the
"<a href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/py_doc/modelspec/programmatic/network/netcon.html">NetCon</a>"
mechanism, which connects the presynaptic and synapse functions via four
parameters - "<strong>threshold</strong>", "<strong>delay</strong>", "<strong>weight</strong>", and
"<strong>release probability</strong>" - we have designed a specific section at the
bottom of the panel, featuring a button labelled "<strong>Edit NetCon
vars</strong>" (Fig.B). This section ensures seamless coordination between the
presynaptic and postsynaptic functions.</p>

<p>In addition, you can use the "<strong>Adjust list filter</strong>" button (<strong>Fig.
18</strong>D) to select and add various synaptic mechanisms that are not yet
included in the Middle panel. This feature allows you to add your
biophysical mechanism and use it to form new synaptic connections,
unlike the standard synaptic mechanisms of “<strong>Neuron</strong>”. New mechanisms
should be uploaded to the "Mechanisms" section/directory.</p>

<p>To accept all modifications with synaptic connections, click the
"<strong>Apply</strong>" button in the same bottom section.</p>

<h2 id="spatially---non-uniform-sources-of-extracellular-ions">Spatially - non-uniform sources of extracellular ions.</h2>

<p>The " Neuron " software starts with a uniform distribution of
extracellular ions. Still, sometimes researchers need to study the
specific spatiotemporal dynamics of these ions, including different
types, neurotransmitters, and neuromodulators. To help with this,
BRAINCELL has added a feature
<img src="assets/media/image73.png" alt="" width="29.43%" height="3.39%" />that lets
users create different scenarios for ion dynamics. To access this
feature, look for the option in the upper right corner of the main panel
and select it. This will take you to the extracellular ion distribution
editor. It's important to remember that using this editor doesn't
consider the potential effect of neuron feedback on ion concentrations.</p>

<p>However, it allows researchers to conduct more detailed investigations
into ion dynamics, leading to a better understanding of how neurons
behave and interact in the extracellular environment.</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/image74.emf" alt="" width="4.16%" height="3.92%" /><img src="assets/media/image75.png" alt="" width="87.35%" height="51.24%" /></p>

<p><strong>Fig. 19. External ionic concentration</strong></p>

<p><strong>A) The existing external sources panel</strong> is a convenient tool for
viewing and managing previously created external sources. Users can
select an external source from this list to edit or delete it.</p>

<p><strong>B) The external source creation panel</strong> allows users to design
software using three templates: point single release, point constant
diffusion, and spherical area of concentration. Users can specify the
location and properties of the external source.</p>

<p><strong>C) The visual graphical panel</strong> allows users to specify the
coordinates and area of an external source by dragging and dropping.
Users can also use Shift to specify the radius of the external source.</p>

<p><strong>Overview (Figure 19):</strong> Users can precisely and flexibly manipulate
the extracellular ion concentrations, accommodating various
spatiotemporal requirements within the system.</p>

<p><strong>1. Modifying Ion Concentrations:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Users can simultaneously create distinct sources of external ion
concentrations, allowing for potential spatial and temporal overlap.</p>
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Source Shape Panel:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Users can define the spatial distribution of ions within or outside
a spherical area.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Source Dynamics:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Users can set three types of ion dynamics over time: constant
activation, instantaneous activation, or toggling on and off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each source has adjustable parameters accessible in the settings
window.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Creating Concentration Series:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Users can create a series based on the concentration change time by
enabling the "Create series" option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Customise series parameters such as interval start number and add
noise for realistic interval variations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Spatial Localisation:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Allows users to position the concentration source spatially.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The panel offers visualisation (in colour) in various planes (XY,
XZ, YZ) and different ion views (individual ion, type of ion, or all
ions).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graphical representation displays extracellular concentration
dynamics upon user interaction (use the right mouse key to choose
“<strong>Extracellular Concentration dynamics graph</strong>”).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Users can comprehensively study and manipulate ion dynamics by utilising
these features, enhancing their understanding of neuron behaviour and
interactions within the extracellular environment.</p>

<p>For further details and interactions, refer to the graphics window's
graphical interface and right-click options for extracellular
concentration dynamic graphs.</p>

<p><strong>Basic set of equation for single on-off release</strong> :</p>

<p><em>For a single point source with “on-off” switch dynamics, the
extracellular concentration (mM) is given by the equation:</em></p>

\[O_{src}(t,\ Distance)\  = \ O_{spc\ basic}\  + \ \frac{{ss}_{src}\ {Radius}_{src}\ \ }{Distance}\left( timeFactor(t\ –\ t_{start})\ –\ timeFactor(t\ –\ t_{end}) \right)\]

<p><em>Where:</em></p>

<p><em>t – the observation time (ms);</em></p>

<p><em>Distance – the distance between the source point and the observation
point (µm);</em></p>

<p><em>Ospc basic – the basic extracellular concentration that takes place
when there is no source (mM); this is the species parameter (Na+, K+
etc.) rather than the source parameter;</em></p>

<p><em>sssrc and Radiussrc – specific surface concentration (mM) and specific
radius (µm) of the point source respectively;</em></p>

<p><em>tstart and tend – the time when the source turns into the active and
then inactive state respectively (ms); tstart &lt; tend;</em></p>

<p><em>timeFactor(Δt) – an auxiliary function (unitless) given by:</em></p>

\[timeFactor(\Delta t)\  = \ \left\{ \begin{matrix}
erfc\left( \frac{Distance}{2\sqrt{{Diff}_{spc}\ \Delta t}} \right) &amp; if\ \Delta t\  \geq \ 0\  \\
0 &amp; if\ \Delta t\  \leq \ 0 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\\]

<p><em>Diffspc – the diffusion coefficient given species and given
temperature (µm2 / ms);</em></p>

<p><em>erfc(*) – the complementary error function; erfc(0) = 1; erfc(∞) =
0.</em></p>

<p><strong>Model Export Feature</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong> The model export feature in BrainCell serves two
primary purposes: saving specific parameters and lengthy calculations
without external graphics or additional features provided by the
software package. To effectively perform calculations, it is essential
to specify which parameters will change during the calculation process.</p>

<p><strong>2. Creating a Parameter File</strong></p>

<p>2.1 Click the "Create File" button (Fig.21A) to initiate the process.</p>

<p>2.2 An additional window (Fig.21B) will open, allowing you to define the
parameters that will be saved.</p>

<p>2.3 If you select "Export Other Parameters," a new window (Fig.21C)
will appear to facilitate this process.</p>

<p><strong>3. Export Parameters Window</strong> The Export Parameters window (Fig.21C)
comprises two sections: a central panel for visualising the selected
parameters and a left panel with five buttons for parameter
manipulation.</p>

<p><strong>3.1 Buttons in the Export Parameters Window:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Add Biophys var."</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clicking this button opens a pop-up window where you can select a
biophysics parameter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The selected parameter will be displayed in the main window.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Figure 21. Exporting Control Parameters using Pop-up Windows</strong></p>

<p><strong>BrainCell allows users to define and export control parameters using
pop-up windows. A. The first window saves specific parameters. B) second
provides a selection interface for customising the output file. C) the
third window gives an example of selecting soma diameter as a parameter.
Users can easily create and export parameters for tailored simulations
and analyses with these pop-up windows.</strong></p>

<h2 id="braincell-software-exporting-computation-run-parameters">BrainCell Software: Exporting Computation Run parameters</h2>

<p>BrainCell allows users to export the results of their calculations by
creating a "Result file" that contains specific variables of interest.
This section explains how to export and record these variables during
calculation.</p>

<p>1. Creating the "<strong>Runner. hoc</strong>" (<strong>Fig.22A</strong>):</p>

<p>- Press the <strong>“Runner. hoc</strong>" button to initiate the creation of the
result file. The file will be named according to the time when the
calculation is completed.</p>

<p>- This step readies the system to record and save the desired variables
in the designated file.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Recording and Saving Variables</strong>:</p>

<p>- Press the "<strong>Record and save some vars</strong>" button, which opens a
graph window (<strong>Fig.22B</strong>).</p>

<p>- To record desired variables during the calculation, users can use the
mouse to place the cursor on the graph window and utilise the "<strong>Print
what</strong>?" function of the standard neuron, as shown in <strong>Figures 22B and
C</strong>.</p>

<p>- The selected variables will be saved to a file as a function of time,
providing valuable data for further analysis.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Performing Calculations on a Parameter Grid</strong>:</p>

<p>- Utilize the "<strong>Make a sweep for some vars</strong>" button (Fig.22 D) to
perform calculations on a parameter grid.</p>

<p>- Unlike previous methods allowing only one input parameter, this
functionality enables users to create a set of input parameters for
automated calculations.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Configuring the Parameter Grid</strong> (<strong>Fig.22E</strong>):</p>

<p>- A pop-up window will appear, allowing users to define the parameters
of the grid.</p>

<p>- Set the initial and final values of the desired parameter and the
step between them.</p>

<p>- Additionally, the pop-up window allows choosing between a linear or
non-linear grid configuration.</p>

<p>Following these steps, users can export computation results by creating
a "<strong>Result file</strong>" with specific variables of interest. The window
(<strong>Fig.22D</strong>) facilitates the selection and recording of variables,
while the parameter grid functionality enables automated calculations on
a range of input parameters. This comprehensive approach enhances
analysis capabilities and allows a more comprehensive exploration of
model behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="braincell-software-managing-cell-models-and-computation-results">BrainCell Software: Managing Cell Models and Computation Results</h2>

<p>This section explains how to export cell models, ensuring easy access to
all relevant properties and computation findings.</p>

<p>The well-organized directory (Fig.23) structure allows users to navigate
easily, and access exported cell models and their corresponding
simulation results. This structure promotes efficient management and
retrieval of relevant files, enabling in-depth analysis and exploration
of cell models and computation outcomes. Below are step-by-step
instructions on how to export the cell model.</p>

<h4 id="creating-a-separate-folder-for-cell-models">Creating a Separate Folder for Cell Models:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The BrainCell allows you to make a distinct folder for a particular
cell when exporting a cell model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To maintain organisation and provide quick access to specific
models, making a new folder for each exported cell is advised.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="folder-structure-and-contents">Folder Structure and Contents:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All the files required for the cell model can be found inside the
newly formed folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The folder will include information about the cell's geometry,
biophysical mechanisms, control files, and computation-related
factors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users may refer to and understand how specific results were obtained
and under what conditions by organising cell models in this way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential feature of the folder is that it keeps the calculation
results linked with the particular cell model.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="loading-cell-files-and-inspecting-cell-configuration">Loading Cell Files and Inspecting Cell Configuration:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A significant feature of these exported files is importing them back
into the BrainCell software. Uploading the cell model file allows
users to thoroughly inspect the entire cell configuration, including
its properties and associated computation results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This feature enhances the user's ability to analyse and understand
the intricacies of cell models, facilitating comprehensive
examination and investigation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By following these guidelines, users can effectively manage and organise
cell models and computation results in the BrainCell software. Creating
separate folders for each exported cell ensures easy access to relevant
files and allows for a detailed examination of the cell's configuration
and associated findings.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 23. Organisational Structure of Imported Cell Models and
Simulation Results</strong></p>

<p><em>Overview:</em> This figure demonstrates the directory structure export of
BrainCell software, showcasing imported cell models and computer
simulation results.</p>

<p><strong>A) Initial Directory View:</strong></p>

<p>In the "Neuron/NanoGeometry" subdirectory, two directories, "Cell1"
and "Cell2," house cell models and related files.</p>

<p><strong>B) Structure of Cell1 Directory:</strong></p>

<p>The directory structure for the "Cell1" folder is displayed in this
window. This structure remains consistent for all saved models.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>"exported cell1" - the exported cell model file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>"nrnmech.dll" - a mechanism file containing relevant computational
mechanisms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>"Runner.hoc" - a calculation management file responsible for
simulations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>"Params.hoc" - a file housing parameters modifiable during
computation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>C) Results Directory:</strong></p>

<p>Within this directory, various result files showcase computation
outcomes for different cell models. In this instance, ten result files
correspond to five calculation parameters. The first file illustrates
action potential (AP) dynamics, while the second file (VARS) displays
selected variable dynamics during the cell export process.</p>

<h2 id="re-import-cell-model">Re-import cell model.</h2>

<p>The "Nano" option (Fig.2) allows you to re-import the model into
BrainCell.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To re-import a cell model, first access the BrainCell software. Then,
select the Nano option (Fig.2) and load the desired cell model. The
user can access all parameters and configurations with this selected
cell model. The user can modify these parameters to perform new
calculations and research. Remember to export to a new folder to avoid
overwriting existing results.</p>

<p><strong>Experimental Version for Model Import</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This feature allows you to integrate external models into the Brain
Cell system, allowing you to analyse, modify, and expand your neural
simulations conveniently. This experimental feature may be subject to
updates and refinements in future versions.</p>

  <p>This feature is currently in experimental development and is subject
to ongoing updates. It enables users to load existing models of
various cells written in the NEURON language, provided they contain at
least one soma and one dendrite. Here's how to utilise this option:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Compile MOD Files:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Before importing, you must combine and compile the MOD files
from the Brain Cell program into a single library and the model
files to be imported. Before calling the “mknrndll” utility,
ensure these files are in the same directory. Place the
generated DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file in the same directory
as the simulation entry point HOC file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Importing the Model:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You can now import the main source file (typically init.hoc)
using the "External Simulation" option.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>During the import process, calculations may start immediately,
but you can pause them and continue the import.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defining Cell Components:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>At this stage, BrainCell prompts you to specify which components
represent dendrites, soma, and axons within the imported model.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Post-Import Modifications:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>After a successful import, you can rename or redefine all
sections of the model as needed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Biophysical Mechanisms and Export:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Once the download is complete, you can review all biophysical
mechanisms, rename them if required, and export the cell.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You now have a model that can be seamlessly imported into the
Brain Cell system for further calculations and modifications.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="simulation-modes-users-can-choose-from-a-variety-of-simulation-modes-to-simulate">Simulation modes: Users can choose from a variety of simulation modes to simulate</h2>

<h3 id="ca1-neuron-voltage">CA1-neuron voltage</h3>

<p>CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) provide a major output of the hippocampus
proper. They integrate information arriving directly from the entorhinal
cortex via the temporoammonic pathway, and indirectly via the
polysynaptic dentate gyrus–CA3–CA1 loop.</p>

<p>The dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus express
numerous types of voltage-gated ion channel, but the distributions or
densities of many of these channels are very non-uniform. Sodium
channels in the dendrites are responsible for action potential (AP)
propagation from the axon into the dendrites (back-propagation); calcium
channels are responsible for local changes in dendritic calcium
concentrations following back-propagating APs and synaptic potentials;
and potassium channels help regulate overall dendritic excitability.</p>

<p><strong>Action Potential Dynamics Calculation</strong></p>

<p>This option performs dynamic calculations of action potentials within a
cell based on the shape you've loaded (note that this shape may differ
from a real pyramidal cell) and the synapses associated with the defined
spines. It's important to note the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cell Shape:</strong> The loaded cell's shape is used for these
calculations, which may not precisely mimic a real pyramidal cell
but will be employed as the basis for the simulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Synapse Definition:</strong> The synapses associated with the defined
spines will be utilized in the action potential dynamics
calculation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, it's crucial to understand that certain aspects will remain
fixed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ion Channel Kinetics:</strong> The kinetics of ion channels within the
cell will adhere to a classical distribution previously defined in
the model. Please refer to the model documentation Migliore et
al. (1999) for detailed information on this distribution. For more
details, you can refer to the model at <a href="https://modeldb.science/2796">[this
link]{.underline}</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This option allows you to explore the action potential dynamics within
the loaded cell shape and synapses you've specified, providing valuable
insights into neural behaviour. </p>

<p><strong>Adapting Cell Sections</strong></p>

<p>If the names of sections (dendrites, soma, or axon) within the loaded 3D
cell structure differ from the typical characteristics of pyramidal
cells, <strong><em>BrainCell</em></strong> will provide a warning. However, if you proceed
despite the warning, <strong><em>BrainCell</em></strong> will automatically insert the
necessary mechanisms into sections it identifies as dendrites, soma, and
axons.</p>

<p>You can easily modify the sections to ensure that your cell's geometry
aligns perfectly with this option. Divide and rename the sections per
the program's recommendations, which will help you fully comply with
the desired cell configuration. This flexibility allows you to tailor
the cell structure to your needs while ensuring a smooth simulation
experience.</p>

<p><strong>Visualizing Electrical Dynamics</strong></p>

<p><img src="assets/media/image98.png" alt="" width="59.97%" height="15.76%" /></p>

<p>The electrical dynamics of the cell are visually represented through
three distinct graphs. The first graph offers an insight into the
dynamics across various cell sections along a spatial path. This spatial
path corresponds to the illustration (in red) provided in the following
figure and depicts the potential dynamics along this path. This
graphical representation lets you observe and analyze the cell's
electrical behaviour.</p>

<h3 id="linescan-frap-experiment-probing-intracellular-connectivity-of-brain-cell">Linescan FRAP experiment: probing intracellular connectivity of Brain Cell</h3>

<p>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) applied for
water-soluble intracellular indicators assesses effective diffusivity
across the cellular compartments adjacent to the bleached area. FRAP
experiments and the corresponding simulations (launched from the main
BrainCell window; Fig. 18c) could be used, therefore to test whether the
modelled astrocyte morphology reproduces intracellular diffusivity
(connectivity) properties documented empirically. The default values
correspond to the data obtained in CA1 astrocyte using linear
(<strong>linescan</strong>) photobleaching tests with Alexa Fluor 594 or Alexa Fluor
488.</p>

<p>This test simulates FRAP with a photobleaching area represented by a
segment (<strong>lines</strong>) in the XY plane. Pressing <strong>'Linescan</strong> <strong>FRAP'</strong>
opens its control window (Fig. 21):</p>

<p>The initiation panel (Fig. 21a) provides the following settings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>'Linescan</strong> <strong>width'</strong> sets the linescan width: in two-photon
excitation mode, the point-spread function of the focused laser beam
is, on average, 1-1.5 µm depending on the system optics; this
parameter is therefore adjustable (within a narrow range).</p>

  <p><strong>'Angle'</strong> and <strong>'Y</strong> <strong>at</strong> <strong>x=0'</strong> set, respectively, the
inclination angle and the y-axis intersect of the photobleaching
(scanning) segment.</p>

  <p><strong>'Initial</strong> <strong>concentration</strong> <strong>(mM)'</strong> sets the photo-bleachable
dye molecules' basal concentration to match the experimental value
(in the configuration of whole-cell dialysis).</p>

  <p><strong>'Photobleaching</strong> <strong>rate'</strong> sets the rate of photobleaching (a
free parameter that can be used to match simulated and experimental
data).</p>

  <p><strong>'Dfree'</strong> sets the intracellular diffusivity of the dye molecules
based on empirical estimates.</p>

  <p><strong>'Bleaching</strong> <strong>recovery</strong> <strong>interactions'</strong> sets the number of
bleaching-recovery periods per trial.</p>

<p>The default duration of FRAP trials is 8000 ms, with photobleaching
occurring every 1000 ms. In addition to the colour-coded shape map
display (Fig. 24b), the results of FRAP simulations could be plotted and
saved using standard NEURON functions: for instance, by selecting and
identifying the cell branch/area of interest ('dendrite' in NEURON
format) using <strong>PointProcessGroupManager,</strong> and next configuring the
output display and store using the <strong>Graph</strong> menu (Fig. 24c).</p>

<h3 id="modelling-intracellular-calcium-dynamics">Modelling intracellular calcium dynamics</h3>

<p><strong>BrainCell</strong> provides simulation and analyses of the intracellular Ca2+
dynamics - including entry, buffering, diffusion, regenerative waves,
and removal - across the entire astrocyte morphology. This type of
simulation may require significant computational resources.
Shorter-duration (1-1000 ms) trials could be feasible on the Host
computer alone. Simulating more extended events over large cell areas
will probably require a dedicated Worker computer/cluster. This
computation can be done after the export cell with critical parameters.</p>

<p>The current BrainCell version enables simulation of the two following
scenarios: (i) macroscopic Ca2+ dynamics over the entire cell morphology
and (ii) oscillatory, single-channel type Ca2+ entry dynamics on the
nanoscopic or microscopic scale within one or two selected processes.</p>

<h3 id="ca2-wave-simulations">Ca2+ wave simulations</h3>

<p>Pressing the <strong>'Calcium</strong> <strong>wave'</strong> key on the main control panel
opens new windows (Fig. 26) for setting, controlling, and displaying

<p>BrainCell employs the standard NEURON-integrated mathematical formalism
of Ca2+ reaction-diffusion kinetics, including buffering and removal,
which has been tested and validated in numerous studies; its detailed
description can be found in the <strong><em>radius.mod</em></strong> file. The basic set of

These parameters should be further constrained by the user based on
specific experimental tests.</p>

<p>A new simulation run can start once the current run has ended.
<strong>'Graph'</strong> panel (Fig. 26b, bottom) provides [Ca2+] time course in

<p><strong>Calcium Stimulation Parameters Panel (Figure 27a):</strong></p>

<p>The 'Calcium Stimulation Parameters' panel, depicted in Figure 27a,
facilitates the adjustment of critical parameters governing microscopic
Ca2+ entry kinetics. This entry process is hypothesized to comprise a
sequence of stochastic Ca2+ channel openings encompassing
higher-frequency bursts. Notably, many of these parameters still need to
be discovered, emphasizing the need for ongoing investigative
exploration and research.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>'Single Channel Calcium Entry Flux':</strong> Defines the rate of
calcium entry during an individual event.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>'Mean Interval Between Two Calcium Events':</strong> Specifies the
average time interval between consecutive events.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>'Basal Ca2+':</strong> Determines the basal [Ca2+], acting as the
reverse concentration for the linear Ca^2+^ efflux.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>'Rise' and 'Decay':</strong> Set the rise and decay time of Ca2+ flux
during a single channel's opening.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>'Events per Burst':</strong> Defines the number of calcium channels
opening in each burst.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>'Randomness':</strong> Set to 0 for uniformly random channel opening
(Poisson process) or 1 for cyclic channel opening.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>'Burst Onset':</strong> Establishes the time for the onset of the event
burst.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>'IP3 Concentration':</strong> Specifies the initial concentration of
IP3 ions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>'Active Dendrite 1' and 'Active Dendrite 2':</strong> Denote
astroglial processes (referred to as 'dendrites' in NEURON
terminology) where active Ca2+ entry is enabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>'Stimulation Time':</strong> Sets the duration of the simulation run.
In astroglia, Ca2+ dynamics are relatively slow, necessitating a
simulation trial of at least 100 seconds to capture the intricacies
of the process.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Utilizing this panel, users can tailor the simulation parameters to
better comprehend and simulate the nuanced dynamics of calcium entry at
a microscopic level.</p>

  <p>Neuronal plasma membranes are enriched in high-affinity glutamate
transporters which generate rapid inward current upon glutamate
binding. In BrainCell main panel, pressing <strong>'Glutamate</strong>
<strong>transporters'</strong> key opens the menu (Fig. 28), which enables
simulations of the dynamic membrane voltage landscape mapped onto cell
morphology, in response to volume-limited application ('uncaging')
of glutamate at a selected area of the cell.</p>

  <p><strong>'Uncaging</strong> <strong>glutamate'</strong> panel (Fig. 28a, top) provides

<p>This option is to simulate the dynamics of intracellular [K+]
resulting from local K+ input and intracellular redistribution and
efflux / leakage (Fig. 29). From the main panel of BrainCell the user
can activate the potassium dynamics by clicking the button
<strong>'Potassium</strong> <strong>Dynamics'</strong> which prompts the relevant windows (Fig.
29).</p>

<p>A standard NEURON panel (Fig. 29a) is to control simulation and
visualise the outcome. The <strong>'Potassium</strong> <strong>settings'</strong> panel (Fig.

<p>NOTE: The present simulation feature explores the diffusion landscape of
intracellular K+ while approximating the K+ entry and extrusion kinetics
with first-order reactions that are independent of membrane voltage, for
the sake of clarity. A more detailed simulation paradigm could include
further</p>

<p>experimental constrains based on known (voltage- and
concentration-dependent) K+ pumps and channels, extracellular K+
dynamics, and unclamped membrane voltage. Such membrane mechanisms,
including astroglial Kir4.1 channels, are available through the standard
NEURON</p>

<p>The monitoring panel (Fig. 30a) displays colour-coded [K+]in
concentration landscapes mapped onto cell morphology. The corresponding
plot (Fig. 30c) shows the time course of intracellular [K+]in at a
selected location (dendrite [51]). The panel (Fig.30b) shows the
